							Yeah<br>
							I've been tryna call<br>
							I've been on my own for long enough<br>
							Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe<br>
							I'm going through withdrawals<br>
							You don't even have to do too much<br>
							You can turn me on with just a touch, baby<br><br>
							
							I look around and Sin City's cold and empty (oh)<br>
							No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
							I can't see clearly when you're gone<br><br>
							
							I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
							No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
							I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
							Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br>
							Hey, hey, hey<br><br>
							
							I'm running out of time<br>
							'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
							So I hit the road in overdrive, baby<br><br>
							
							Oh, the city's cold and empty (oh)<br>
							No one's around to judge me (oh)<br>
							I can't see clearly when you're gone<br><br>
							
							I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
							No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
							I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
							Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust<br><br>
							
							I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)<br>
							I could never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)<br>
							Will never let you go this time (ooh)<br><br>
							
							I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
							No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
							Hey, hey, hey<br><br>
							
							Hey, hey, hey<br><br>
							
							I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
							No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
