						하이브리드 밴드 Clean Bandit! 스웨덴 팝스타 Zara Larsson와 함께한 싱글 ‘Symphony’<br/>
						공식 싱글 차트에서 9주 동안 1위를 지킨, 가장 성공적인 싱글로 꼽히는 ‘Rockabye’를 잇는 신곡 ‘Symphony’는 스웨덴의 팝스타 Zara Larsson의 가세로 발표와 동시에 큰 관심을 얻고 있다. 아직 제목이 정해지지 않은 두 번째 스튜디오 앨범의 세 번째 공식 싱글이 될 ‘Symphony’는 이전에 발표한 싱글 ‘Tears‘처럼 느린 템포로 시작해 서사시적인 댄스로 끝을 맺는다.<br/>
						Clean Bandit과 Zara Larsson, 두 인기 아티스트가 만들어 낼 또 한 번의 정상 ’Symphony‘!<br/>

							I've been hearing symphonies<br>
							Before, all I heard was silence<br>
							A rhapsody for you and me<br>
							And every melody is timeless<br>
							Life was stringing me along<br>
							Then you came and you cut me loose<br>
							Was solo, singing on my own<br>
							Now I can't find the key without you<br><br>
							
							And now your song is on repeat<br>
							And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat<br>
							And when you're gone, I feel incomplete<br>
							So, if you want the truth<br><br>
							
							I just wanna be part of your symphony<br>
							Will you hold me tight and not let go?<br>
							Symphony<br>
							Like a love song on the radio<br>
							Will you hold me tight and not let go?<br><br>
							
							I'm sorry if it's all too much<br>
							Every day you're here, I'm healing<br>
							And I was runnin' out of luck<br>
							I never thought I'd find this feeling<br>
							'Cause I've been hearing symphonies<br>
							Before all I heard was silence<br>
							A rhapsody for you and me<br>
							(A rhapsody for you and me)<br>
							And every melody is timeless<br><br>
							
							And now your song is on repeat<br>
							And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat<br>
							And when you're gone, I feel incomplete<br>
							So, if you want the truth<br><br>

							Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
							Ah ah, ah<br>
							Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah<br>
							Ah ah, ah<br><br>
							
							And now your song is on repeat<br>
							And I'm dancin' on to your heartbeat<br>
							And when you're gone, I feel incomplete<br>
							So, if you want the truth (oh)<br><br>
							
							I just wanna be part of your symphony<br>
