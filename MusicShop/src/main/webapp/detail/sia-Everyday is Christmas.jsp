                        최고의 작곡가이자 팝 보컬리스트인 시아 (Sia) 크리스마스 캐롤 앨범 [Everyday Is Christmas] 디럭스 버전 발매!<br>
						현 세대를 대표하는 최고의 작곡가이자 팝 보컬리스트인 시아 (Sia)가 지난해 발매한 크리스마스 캐롤 앨범 [Everyday Is Christmas]에 세 개의 보너스 트랙을 더한 디럭스 버전을 발표했다.<br/> 
						발매와 함께 많은 사랑을 받은 시아의 캐롤 발라드 'Snowman'을 포함한 기존 오리지널 캐롤 10곡과 미국 싱어송라이터 Terry Como의 히트곡 'Round and Round'을 그녀만의 방식으로 재해석한 버전,<br> 
						그리고 두 개의 또 다른 오리지널 트랙인 'Sing For My Life'와 'My Old Santa Claus'을 담아낸 이 앨범으로 시아가 만들어낸 크리스마스 세계에 다시 한번 빠져보자.<br/>
